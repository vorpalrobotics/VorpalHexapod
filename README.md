# VorpalHexapodArduino
Arduino code for both the Vorpal Hexapod and Vorpal Hexapod Gamepad.

This is the Arduino IDE code for the current version of the Vorpal Hexapod Project.

To compile it you need the latest CMUCAM5 (Pixie) library, and also the Adafruit 16 Channel Servo Controller Library.

The current 3D model files are posted on Thingiverse.com, search for "Vorpal Hexapod" and you'll find it. There are Things there for the robot, gamepad, and each activity and accessory.

SOURCING THE ELECTRONICS
------------------------

You are welcome to source all the parts yourself, but we respectfully ask you to consider buying some or all of the parts from our store:
http://store.vorpalrobotics.com

Buying our kits cuts at least 1.5 to 2 hours off the assembly time because we give you all the electronics pre-soldered, bluetooth modules are pre-configured to pair with each other automagically, and of course you know you're getting all compatible parts that work with the 3D models perfectly.

We have both kits and also each part individually so you can pick and choose what you source yourself and what you source through our store.
